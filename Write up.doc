311 Unified Data (Utilities and City Services)
"Non-emergency 311 call systems, used increasingly in U.S. cities, offer a number of advantages. They give citizens a quick, convenient way to kvetch about problems in their neighborhoods, and get a response." (Reference: NextCity, Website)

Since the data is updating currently, we choose the data from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX.
  Reasons:
    Relatively clean, and complete.
    Interest to this unfamiliar dial, unlike 911.
  Questions:
    The pattern of City Services Requests, between different type and corresponding time, location, and method.
    Calculating the duration between request created and closed, in order to see how efficient of city services

 Analysis:
 
 1. Service type
 The most is Austin Code-Request Code Officer. But four of the top ten service types are related to animals (Dead animals, loose dog,    animal control, injured/sick animals). Q: Why so many service cases related to animals? (查点文字资料）
 
 2. Number of cases among months
 The number of cases increases with the tempretures. When in summer, the number of cases reach the highest and when in winter, it decreases to the least. (和Austin tempreture dataset 一起分析)
 
 3. Top 5 rank of service type over month
 For all month, the top 1 service type is Austin Code. (画图后再写，表格太长）
 
 4. Owning Department
 The top ten departments with most cases are Austin Code Department, Animal Services Office, Austin Resource Recovery, Transportation, Transportation, Parks & Recreation Department, Austin Energy Department, Health & Human Services, Economic Development Department, Austin Water Utility. The top 3 departments all have more than 60,000 cases while the last 5 ones are all lower than 20000. Among all these, it is abnormal to see animal departments have such high number of cases.
 
 5. Proportion of case number of top 5 departments over time (趋势不是很明显）
 Code Department: slitly upward
 Animal service: downward trend
 Austin Resources: 
 Public work:
 Transportation: 
 
 6. The trends of request methods over years. (代码我写在另一个文件里，用循环对每种method都做了图)
 Digital reporting methods, such as web and social media, are growing over years.
 
 7. The trends of request types over years. (同上)
 
 8. The change in the number of cases in each department over years. (同上)
 
 Argument (bonus):
 1. Relationship of number of cases with tempreture
